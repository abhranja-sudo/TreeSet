# BTree

The aim for this TreeSet to be able to replace java.util.TreeSet. 

Our TreeSet uses B-Tree for implementation instead of
Red-Black Tree that java.util.TreeSet uses.

A B-tree is a tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, insertions, and deletions in
logarithmic amortized time. Unlike self-balancing binary search trees

It is optimized for systems that read and
write large blocks of data. It is most commonly used in database and file systems.
